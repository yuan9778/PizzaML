## [Project0: PizzaML](http://project0.nelsonreitz.com)

Live demonstration: [http://project0.nelsonreitz.com](http://project0.nelsonreitz.com)

This project is a fictive website built as an exercice for the [Computer Science E-75](http://cs75.tv) online course. The purpose of this
exercise is to give an introduction to the MVC pattern and PHP.

As per the project [specification](http://cdn.cs75.net/2012/summer/projects/0/project0.pdf), the goal was to build a dynamic
website based on a pizza restaurant [menu](http://cdn.cs75.net/2012/summer/projects/0/menu.pdf). The original menu being quite disorganised,
the first challenge was to design a data model for the menu using XML. The remaining process was using PHP to display the menu data
and implement a shopping cart with common operations (create, read, update, delete).

The website's functionality could be significantly improved by using Javascript but it would go beyond the scope of the exercise.

#### To do
- Prettier URLs with `mod_rewrite`
- `public/order.php` refactoring
